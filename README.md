real-time-analytics
===================

A simple proof of concept for real-time analytics with Node.js and Socket.io


I haven't bothered to create a `package.json` file yet, so for how, if you want to try this out, you'll have to install dependancies like with this: `npm install express jade socket.io`.

This will be updated at some point. The initial sample is explained [here](http://markrabey.com/2014/05/05/real-time-analytics-with-node-js-socket-io/).
